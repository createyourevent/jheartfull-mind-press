# Problem 38: * Configurations and Open Source incompatibilities:


NOTE: JhipsterPress is changing its name to Springular, so be aware of it! I apologize for the inconvinience

I can not share with you the email configuration from www.sendinblue.com (which I recommend to use). To avoid having an incomplete download I copied the files with an outdated configuration password into the /jhipsterpress/miscelanea/config

Where you will find a working copy of:

- application-dev.yml
- application-heroku.yml
- application-prod.yml
- application-tls.yml
- application.yml
- bootstrap-heroku.yml

Be careful with publishing config data. I did it by mistake on GitHub and 5 minutes later the account was being used to spam email.
